    lyrics: Look at the stars
            Look how they shine for you
            And everything you do
            Yeah they were all yellow
            I came along
            I wrote a song for you
            And all the things you do
            And it was called "Yellow"
            So then I took my turn
            Oh what a thing to have done
            And it was all yellow
            Your skin
            Oh yeah, your skin and bones
            Turn into something beautiful
            You know, you know I love you so
            You know I love you so
            I swam across
            I jumped across for you
            Oh what a thing to do
            'Cause you were all yellow
            I drew a line
            I drew a line for you
            Oh what a thing to do
            And it was all yellow
            Your skin
            Oh yeah your skin and bones
            Turn into something beautiful
            And you know
            For you I'd bleed…
